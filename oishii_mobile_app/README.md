## Stretch Goals
<ol>
<li>Store Recipes with Local Storage instead of memory
- Perhaps use Hive
<li>Add Photos to Recipes - I'm a visual person and love it when menus in restaurants have a photo of the food, so this is a must
<li>Add search functionality - Eventually will need this with the amount of cooking I do
<li>A share feature - My family are all foodies so this would be cool to add for them
<li>Better UX/UI - My definitely not the prettiest app right now
</ol>

### Happy Cooking! üç≥
